":" denotes the delimiter between tokens

from id is the source (request emiter)
to id is the receiver (request receiver)

name must be unique for each thing. note the delimiter must not be part of the message

general structure is like:

request:thing_type:thing_name:destination_thing_name:data_to_send

 "request" is an operation instruction to be executed by  the server

operations

request connection: client sends upon opening socket

AUTH:thing_type:thing_name


commands and info exchange:


SEND:from_name:to_name:instruction:data

ask for data

ASK:from_name:to_name:instruction:data


instructions to things are( for now )

SET  value of pin

GET value of pin


todo:

need a set of server isnstructions and parser

server instructions begin with #
